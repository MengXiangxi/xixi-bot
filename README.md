# xixi-bot
Use this script to auto-reply "囍" in WeChat groups.

## What is Xi^2
I do not really know what is the exact meaning of this character. It is often used to express a sense of auspicious, a pursuit of happiness, an ultimate destiny of joy and luck, among [Ingress](https://ingress.com/)ers in Peking University.

## What is xixi-bot used for?
The function is too simple and straightforward: once anyone (except you yourself) in the WeChat group send a message containing the character of 囍, you will automatically reply a 囍.

## How is it implemented?
Thanks to [itchat](https://github.com/littlecodersh/ItChat) project, WeChat APIs are provided. With this package, I can easily define an auto-reply bot within ten lines of codes. 囍！
